/**
 * Webpack loader that resolves a brand-specific implementation inside
 * source files at build time.
 *
 * It scans the source for imports of the form `from "<any-path>.<brand>"`
 * (relative, absolute, or aliased; optionally followed by .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx) and rewrites
 * the module so that only the implementation for the currently selected
 * `brand` is imported and re-exported.
 *
 * Expected loader options:
 * - brand: string     // the active brand to select (e.g. "piknik")
 *
 * Processing steps:
 * 1) Ensure the file calls `brandPick(...)` to confirm brandized imports
 *    are intentional in this file.
 * 2) Find imports that look like `from "./name.<brand>"`.
 * 3) Choose the import that matches the active `brand`, compute its absolute
 *    path (extension omitted so webpack resolves via `resolve.extensions`), and
 *    register it as a dependency for watch mode.
 * 4) Emit a proxy module that:
 *    - imports ONLY the default export from the chosen module
 *    - re-exports it as the default (without re-exporting named exports)
